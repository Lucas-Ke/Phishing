            To make sure phishing doesn't happen to you, here are some steps
          </p>

    <main class="steps">
      <ul>
        <li class="step-1">
          The first way in order to protect yourself is to make sure you trust
          the person sending you the link. If you do not know the person they
          will most likely be a scammer phishing for your data.
        </li>
        <li class="step-2">
          A second way to protect yourself is to check the greeting. Scammers
          often try to get you off guard and make their messages seem like
          emergencies so you won't think when you click them.
        </li>
        <li class="step-3">
          The third way to stay safe is to be cautious of the message's
          spelling. The spelling in scammers emails typically have some spelling
          mistakes while a proper business email would have none.
        </li>
        <li class="step-4">
          A fourth way to be safe is to check what the sender calls you. If the
          email is from your friend or a business that you work for or are in
          contact with they will call you by your actual name. If it is from a
          scammer they will most likely use a general greeting.
        </li>
        <li class="step-5">
          Lastly, to know if a message is a scam or not is to check what they
          are sending you. If they are trying to double your money, give you
          more money, or get you a shiny new car they are not. No one online
          that you don’t know would want to give you free stuff. A good rule to
          stick by is that if it’s too good to be true it most likely is.

      </ul>
